Comentário: Battlefield Earth is without a doubt one of the most distasteful examples of cinema I have ever come across. That being said, I bought the DVD and have watched it about 8 times already. If you are like me, and you like sitting through a "serious" movie and laughing at how funny and bad it is, you should definitely check out this movie. Every time I watch it I find more and more hilarious plot inconsistencies, and the slanted camera angles and dialogue never cease to amuse. I guess since this film is somewhat affiliated with Hubbards hokey religion, there is no cursing to be found in the movie. Instead we get to hear how many ways you can use the word "crap." In several situations Travolta refers to specific unpleasants events as being "crap-lousy." It's hilarious and has to be seen to be appreciated. In conclusion, if you fancy yourself a MST3K type critic, you will surely enjoy this crap-lousy movie.

Comentário: One thing is clear. Until i met a great educational flick called 'House Of The Dead' by Dr. Uwe Boll, there had been not a single film that i decided stop watching in the middle of viewing. Yes i mean it. I never quit a movie in the middle of watching it no matter how it sucks or bores because i'm a type of guy who is over-patient and likes the phrase "it ain't over til it's over". Once i play a movie, then i finish it by all means, only unless inevitable things happen and force me to quit it in the middle. That was basic cinema-watching attitude of mine for 30 years. And then suddenly, one day about a year ago, i happened to meet this great educational flick and it broke my history just like a revolution. I played it, and Jesus can you believe, i quit and ran exactly at 40 minutes without any special situations or reasons. Yogi, i'm afraid you're wrong. Something must be over before it's over... That's not only thing that i learned from this great educational flick. I admit that i generally tend to ignore (or intentionally skip) others' reviews or comments on some films which i've not seen yet, and especially for majority of opinions i don't care for them at all. Yes it's just like "I don't listen to anybody before viewing it myself and valuating is just mine"..... But with this great educational flick, i learned that sometimes i need to be more open to others' WARNINGS at least. After all, this film had such huge educational effects on me and i can't help giving it 10/10 for it.

Comentário: i loved this movie so I gave it a 10!I thought Jamie Kennedy did a great job in this movie.It was a great sequel to the first.By the way I am older than eleven when I saw this.The jokes were very funny.But I have to admit that the only two people funny in this movie was Jamie Kennedy and the baby.but other than that it was great movie in my opinion.The plot was very easy to follow. I say that movie execs should make more movies like this.I say that I did not waste two to three hours watching this movie.i spent three hours watching one of the funniest movies ever. So as you can see my opinion is very easy this was a great movie.

Comentário: I loved the movie!!! It isn't really made for lost people. It's for Christians, and it has amazing points in it!!! It allows viewers to see Christmas in a different way than they ever have before!!! If you don't love Jesus then I wouldn't say you should go see it. However, if you do love Jesus then you gotta go see this movie. If you think people are no longer focused on Jesus during this time of year then you really need to go see it. I was amazed at some of the things Krik said because I have read and heard the stories he spoke of, but I have never put two and two together. The movie is a must see for any believer, and it's very family friendly.

Comentário: One day I was feeling suicidal. I was about to jump out of my 30 story building of flats, and then my friend stopped me and told me to watch this movie. This movie is honest to the title, and stopped me from committing suicide, and gave me a brighter perspective on life. I genuinely soiled my pants laughing at the comedic scenes like the pirate dance scene, Thank you epic movie, 10/10 would recommend.

Comentário: I still remembering the first time when i saw the film in 2008 after i heard so much about it ( the worst film of the year ) so i thought i'm gonna see something you can called disaster, but it was good one making you laughing , yes there is at some points over acting from Paris Hilton especially at the party scene when she is wearing a wedding dress but for( God Sake) she wasn't that bad( remember she isn't Meryl Streep and i gave it 10 not because the movie deserve it but because to many people attacked it without any reason ( just because they don't like Paris Hilton) i hope it will get much better reviews in the future , and ask everyone to give it what it is deserve

Comentário: This movie really makes you feel like a superbaby genius. This movie is a masterpiece and everyone should give it a watch as the writing, cinematograph and acting compares to movies like Godfather and Shawshank Redemption and the level of writing is comparable to a Song Of Ice And Fire by George R R Martin

Comentário: Words cannot describe how greatly this movie changed my life. The year was 2014. My legs were gone. My children, somewhere in Ukraine. My wife stolen from me by the Government. Everything was going wrong for me. One day, I decide to rent Birdemic: Shock and Terror. The moment the movie started, my spirits lifted. Its four minute intro of only driving made me forget about my wife and children almost immediately. Then, the first words were spoken: "h i" I'd like to pay whoever casted this because they did an amazing job. The audio quality is also the best I've ever seen. Yes, this movie has gifted me the ability to see sound. Continuing, every word that was spoken inspired me as a person. I also learned, in detail, how to use a gun, which, I now find very helpful. Immediately after the movie ended, I heard a knock at my door. My legs had returned to me, kicking the door down and attaching themselves to my waist. With this first amazing thing happening to me, I had the motivation to fix everything. I flew to the White House, killing the president immediately with my bird-like stare. I grabbed my wife from the clutches of his arms and lifted her into the air with my newly grown wings, holding her with my feet. The children were next. We soon arrived in Ukraine, my children screaming when they saw me. There were tears in their eyes and they were backing away from shock. They missed me so dearly. I grabbed both and put them in my pelican-like beak, and began flying home. Birdemic: Shock and Terror is the reason I am still alive.

Comentário: ...... I was age 16 back in 1966 attending Andress High School in El Paso, Texas and heard about the WORLD PREMIERE of the movie "Manos: The Hands of Fate" .... there were write-ups about it in the two major papers and coverage on the local TV stations. I did not attend the WORLD PREMIERE, but I checked the newspaper listings and went on a Saturday afternoon.... I thought it was going to be a scary movie, and after about ten minutes or so I started to giggle a little. I noticed others at the downtown El Paso theater were laughing a little too. Well, I can't recall what the exact scene was, but suddenly it was so funny I had tears rolling down my face! The movie was worth the ticket price (probably a Dollar) but I thought I was going to see a scary movie and it turned out to be a comedy. Long before the media called it the worst movie, I knew it was the worst for me even before the movie was over! People were laughing and smiling as they left the movie; and, I and they did not know that years later it would be famous -- but not in a way the cast and crew would have ever envisioned. Perhaps the movie was too misunderstood my many. God Bless all of those -- living and dead -- who were involved with the movie "Manos: The Hands of Fate" back in 1966.....
